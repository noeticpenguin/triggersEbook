# Level set

###Expectations
That said, lets set a couple of expectations. I don't expect you to finish this book and be a Master Trigger Builder. I do expect you'll be able to *read and **understand*** the contents of a Trigger from your org. I expect you'll have the knowledge to start playing with triggers **in a sandbox.**

###Sandboxes for fun and profit
[Developer.Salesforce.com](http://Developer.salesforce.com) not only has a wealth of information in the form of books, cheatsheets and developer forums (remember, you're a developer now.) but it also contains the magical, mystical button "Sign up" by which Salesforce will give you a Developer Org. If you've never signed up for a developer org, go do it now. Don't worry, I'll wait for you.

We'll be working in a development org. Developer Orgs or Dev orgs have all the Metadata capabilities of a production org, but very little storage space. As my hero Genie said to Aladdin:
> Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space!

Perhaps the most important characteristic of a Dev org is that it's just for you. There's no one else to log in and critique your code. There's no one to make fun of the fact that your test Accounts and Contacts have a Disney *Frozen* theme. After all, *winter is coming*. But the best part of a Dev org is that if you find yourself at the bottom of a deep dark hole, dug one-mistake-past-the-undo-button... Well you can just throw it away, and start over with
```

A Brand NEW CAR! err... dev org.
