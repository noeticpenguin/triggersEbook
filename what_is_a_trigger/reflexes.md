![Hammer of Doom!](http://iam.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Reflex-Hammer-SW-H04-.jpg)

We're all familiar with the strange triangular hammer. Of *doom*. Doctor hit's us in the knee, and we kick the doctor. (or is that just me?) The key to reflexes is that they're automatic, and programmed deep inside of us. Likewise, Salesforce Triggers work on a deep system level. Fortunately for us, we get to program them and, as it turns out, it's pretty easy.

Salesforce has provided us the building blocks for defining both the cause and effect of Triggers. We are the masters of our orgs.
