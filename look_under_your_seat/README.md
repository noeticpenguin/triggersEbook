#Look under your seat!

If we're going to succeed in writing Triggers, we have a few things we need to get straight. First, we need to undestand what it means to develop and to be a developer. Developer is one of those words invented by HR so they could classify resources into departments and income brackets. (All the while forgetting, that if we're resources, they're ... overhead.) I think it's high time that we define for ourselves what a developer is:

> Developers are those people who add or modify the functionality of software.

Because of this, I can't let you continue under *the misguided notion that you're just an Admin. You're a Salesforce Developer.* If you've ever created a workflow rule, changed an assignment rule, created a user, modified a report or ... suffice it to say, *you are a developer*. Yes you, All of you. You're all Developers! (Look under your seat!). All apologies to Mr. Button Click Admin but there's very little "admin" to what we do.

You're not going to argue with me, are you?
